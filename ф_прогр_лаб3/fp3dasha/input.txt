Programming is one of the most important disciplines in modern computer science.
It allows developers to create complex software systems that are used in science, business, and everyday life.
Functional programming is based on mathematical principles and treats functions as the primary building blocks of programs.
The Haskell programming language is a well-known example of a purely functional language.
It supports strong static typing, lazy evaluation, and powerful abstraction mechanisms.
Because of these features, Haskell programs are often more reliable and easier to reason about formally.
However, for beginners, the functional approach may seem difficult and unusual at first.
Gradual learning of concepts such as recursion, higher-order functions, and monads significantly simplifies the learning process.
Programming textbooks usually contain a large number of examples that demonstrate the core ideas of a language.
Such examples help students understand both the syntax and the semantics of programs more deeply.
The use of practical exercises is an essential part of effective programming education.
That is why laboratory assignments play an important role in the training of future information technology specialists.
